Each time new features are added and tested, or bug are fixed, we should add a point release, starting from 0.1
For example: 0.11
The version will depend on the relevance of the changes made, which is something we have to define
At a certain point, with major functions added and many bug fixes, we could freeze the development of new features for a while,
then start testing and fixing bug as much as we can and finally release a major release, for example 1.0.
After that, start again adding point releases. ;)
