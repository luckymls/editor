Each time new features are added and tested, or bug are fixed, we should add a point release, starting from 0.1
For example: 0.11
The version will depend on the relevance of the changes made, which is something we have to define
At a certain point, with major functions added and many bug fixes, we could freeze the development of new features for a while,
then start testing and fixing bug as much as we can and finally release a build release, for example 1.0.
After that, start again adding point releases. ;)

We could establish before the features of a certain build release, and go trough the various steps: alfa, beta, release-candidate
(this one could preceed the stable build, it is when we stop the development and concentrate on correcting bugs)
